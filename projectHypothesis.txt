Crime in Atlanta between 2009-2020


Hypothesis:
The hypothesis of this study is that the majority of crimes reported in Atlanta are nonviolent property crimes and that these crimes are more likely to occur on Fridays and Saturdays compared to other days of the week.


Problem Statement:
Crime is a pervasive issue in urban areas, with significant implications for public safety, economic stability, and community well-being. Understanding the nature and patterns of crime is crucial for effective law enforcement and policymaking. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of crime in Atlanta, with a focus on identifying the types of crimes reported to the Atlanta Police Department (APD) and the temporal distribution of these incidents.

The primary hypothesis guiding this research is that a substantial proportion of crimes reported in Atlanta are nonviolent property crimes, including theft, burglary, and vandalism. Additionally, it is postulated that there is a temporal pattern in the occurrence of these crimes, with a higher frequency observed on Fridays and Saturdays compared to other days of the week.

By examining the crime data provided by the Atlanta Police Department and analyzing the types and temporal distribution of reported incidents, this study seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the crime landscape in Atlanta. The findings of this research can inform law enforcement strategies, resource allocation, and community initiatives aimed at reducing crime rates and enhancing public safety in the city.
